            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough the Obligations which you have laid upon me, Require greater Acknowledgments than I am capable of making at this time; yet I shall Ingenuously Confess, that they have had the least share in Engaging me to those Respects which I am now about to pay you. No, <hi>Madam,</hi> Nothing but your abundant Charity, of which I have been often both a Witness and a Steward upon several Occasions, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon this, hath Entituled you
<pb facs="tcp:33157:4"/>to this Dedication: For besides the Yearly Allowance of Five Pounds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Maintenance of this School, and the Addition of Ten Pounds more the last Year, towards the Binding of the poor Children of it unto Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Trades, the giving of Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds more to be Improv'd to the same purpose for ever, makes it so much your Due, that it would be an inexcusable Omission, to publish these weak Endeavours of mine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Service of this Excellent and Needful Piece of Charity, and not to do it under your Name, whose Heart GOD hath inclin'd by all these Ways that I have mention'd, to give such great Encouragement thereto. Nor will any of the rest of the Benefactors I am Confident take it ill, that I have thus singled you out from amongst them upon this Occasion; since, as I must always bear them Witness, that they have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted towards this Charitable Design, with all the Cheerfulness imaginable, so I am well assured, that they will rather Rejoice to see it so effectually promoted
<pb facs="tcp:33157:4"/>by so liberal an Augmention of its Stock, than in any wise suspect that there is the least Injury done to their Memories there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. If therefore, I can but as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my self against your Resentments, for making your Name so Publick, as I promise my self I shall, against any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of theirs, I shall be the less concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at any thing that may happen to me from a Censorious World, since the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty of the Intention, and the Justice of the Occasion, will in a great Measure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse all the Defects that may be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this Performance: Nor will I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Dispair of your Pardon, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing so much against your Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Design; sincee he who hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us in the Distribution of our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Not to let our Left Hand know what our Right Hand doth,</hi> hath also Commanded us, to <hi>let the light of our Good Works so to Shine before Men, that they may see it, and Glorifie our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> You, I am sure, hate <hi>blowing of a Trumpet before your Alms;</hi> and can more readily Embrace the most expensive Opportunity of doing Good, than endure to hear of it again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards;
<pb facs="tcp:33157:5"/>and indeed it well becomes you, (for nothing is a greater Argument of a Vain Mind, than an Affectation of affixing our Name to any Publick Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) but it would be a Fault in me, whose Duty and Business it is to do it for others, not to make the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet Sound loud upon so just an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, especially too, since your many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goods Works, like those of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Virtuous Woman, do so much <hi>Praise you in the Gates;</hi> in which, and in every thing else that becomes our most Holy Profession, that you, and all those Worthy Persons, that have so readily lent their Charitable Assistance to so Good a Work as this is, may Abound and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper, till you all come to receive those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Rewards that are promised to all those that are thus <hi>ready to do Good, and willing to Communicate,</hi> is, and shall be, the Daily Prayer of,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE great Necessity and Ʋsefulness of Catechising is so well known, both from Scripture and Experience, that I need say but little of it here; there being nothing whatsoever that serves the true Interest of Religion more, than an Honest and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Care of it doth; for according as Men are by this Means Instructed and Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Faith, they do commonly either Maintain, or give it up, whenever it is undermin'd by Errour and Heresie on the one Hand, or more openly attacked by Profaneness or Persecution on the Other: This Our Adversaries of the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:33157:6"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> know but too too well, by the Ground which they have gain'd, or lost, upon us, by the Ʋse or Neglect of it; and therefore they desire nothing more than to see us diverted from it, whilst among themselves, they do as Studiously endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote it, expecting a greater Harvest of Proselytes from this, than from any other Course which they can take; and therefore distrusting the strength of <hi>Balak</hi>'s Arms to reduce us by force, they have had recourse to <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Counsels, by Ignorance, Sloth and Luxury, to entice us into the Snares which they have laid for us; among which, that of obtaining the Education of our Children is none of the least; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the last Reign, having obtained the Royal Authority and Assistance, to Recommend it the more Powerfully, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Popish Schools were Erected, where the Children of all sorts of Persons were to be freely Taught, whatever was to be Learned in any of the greatest Schools in <hi>England;</hi> and such Fair and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Proposals were then also publickly
<pb facs="tcp:33157:6"/>Printed, as tempted several Ʋnwary and Necessitous Persons to send their Children thither: The Mischievous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this, being easily perceived, were as Prudently provided against; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> the Jesuit Taught, was the most E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and Dangerous, both for its Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and Proposals, the Reverend Dr. <hi>Tenison,</hi> whose Parish joyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, like a good Watchful Shepheard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Flock, which was thus dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously beset by Romish Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing, having long before founded a Free-School of the same Nature, did at this Time open another, where, about Four Hunderd Poor Children were freely Taught, whatever they should be Capable of Learning, not only in Latin and Greek, but in Religion and Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners too; and so far did this Honest and Pious Design, by the Blessing of God, Succeed and Prosper, that the Jesuits-School apparently declined, even when Popery it self seem'd most to Flourish and Prevail. The same Considerations also
<pb facs="tcp:33157:7"/>wrought as effectually upon several Pious and Well-Disposed Persons, belonging to the New Church in St. <hi>Margarets West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> (whose Forwardness and Zeal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Charitable Occasion that hath been Recommended to them, I must always bear Witness of, and Testifie) to do something Answerable thereunto; and accordingly they soon agreed, by a Quarterly Contribution, to maintain a Free-School, where Fifty Poor Children, whose Parents were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pay for their Teaching, should be daily Instructed in the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Good Manners, till by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting therein, and also in Writing and Arithmetick, they should be Capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put out as Apprentices, to some Honest and Ʋseful Callings; and that then they would give a Competent Sum of Money out of the Common Stock, to bind them out thereto. This, though it were Inferiour to the other Schools in the Advantages of Humane Learning, as well as Numbers; yet being a good Work in it self, and very useful, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at that time, I could not but rejoyce in it, and offer my utmost Assistance to the
<pb facs="tcp:33157:7"/>couraging of it; and accordingly Composed this Exposition in order to its Service: Nay, to make it the more Ʋseful, I have, upon the several Lords Days immediately prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Monthly Sacrament, after the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Lesson at Evening Prayer, not only Examined the Children publickly therein, but also for the Good and Benefit of others, at the same time, made some farther En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements thereupon, both for Instruction and Practice. I am not Ignorant what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have been used not only to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage so Good a Work as this is, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to Blast and bring it to nothing; but as it hath been continued hitherto, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of above Fifty Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> notwithstanding all that hath been done of that Nature, and amidst the publick Taxes, and other Charitable Contributions, which have been very great indeed; so I Question not, but the same Pious Zeal, which so readily gave it a Being, will as cheerfully Maintain and Advance it too: However, lest through the Mutability of all Humane Affairs, it should at any time hereafter cease, that what hath been hitherto done, may not
<pb facs="tcp:33157:8"/>be utterly lost and forgotten; nay, that so Good a Work may be rendred yet more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by its Example and Management, I have thought fit thus to publish to the World this Account of it, to the Glory of God, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Religion, and the Honour of so many Worthy Benefactors, and (if I may without Vanity say so of such weak Endeavours as these are) I hope not without some prospect of doing Good to others, who perhaps more need such plain and easie Instructions, than those that are more Elaborate and Profound: For to my great Astonishment, as well as Trouble, I have found even among Grey-Hairs, as great Want of such Things as amongst Children, there being but too too many even among us, who, though Men and Women in Years, are but meer <hi>Babes in Christ, and have need,</hi> as the Apostle says, <hi>to be Taught the very first Principles of the Oracles of God.</hi> If therefore what I have thus done, may by its Plainness and Perspicuity afford them any help to their greater Proficiency, I shall be heartily glad of it: However, I hope, I may be born with (though in my Weakness and Infirmities)
<pb facs="tcp:33157:8"/>for the Honesty of my Intention, and for shewing my Good Will to so necessary and Ʋseful a Work, which is all the Apology I shall make for this Ʋndertaking, being so far from Offering to Excuse it, for being Plain and Ordinary, that I shall readily declare, that if I could have told how to have made it more so, I would certainly have done it. May therefore the great God, who <hi>out of the Mouths of Babes and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ordains Strength, even to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of those that appear most Mighty,</hi> so prosper these weak Endeavours, that they may bring Glory to his Name, in the Edification and Salvation of Souls, through Jesus Christ our Lord, and I have sufficiently attained my end, and shall be the less concerned at whatever shall be said of what I have done.</p>

            <p>Q. <hi>What do you mean by a Negative and Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Preoept?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A Negative Precept sorbids a Sin, and an Affirmative one enjoyns a Duty.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why are these Commands then Propounded for the most part Negatively, rather than Affirmatively?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To shew the Proneness of our Nature unto Evil, and to teach us the better how to be truly good.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How does this teach you the better to be truly Good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because when all Evil is restrain'd and rooted out, we shall be the more capable of being so.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:33157:25"/>
            <p> Q. <hi>But is it enough for us in a Negative Precept to Abstain from the Sin, and in an Affirmative one to Practice the Duty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, for where any Sin is forbidden, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Duty is also enjoyn'd; and where any Duty is commanded, the contrary Sin is forbidden.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What difference is there between a Negative and an Affirmative Precept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In the extent and force of the Obligation, for I am never to do what is forbidden, but I may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times omit what is Commanded.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Give an Instance in the Commandments for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I am never to commit Idolatry, Murder or Adultery, but I may do works of Necessity and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon a Lord's Day, and refuse to obey my Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours when I shall thereby dishonour God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why are these Commands enjoyn'd in the second Person singular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To shew that no Persons whatsoever are free from the most necessary Obligations thereto.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>From whence do those Obligations arise?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> From God's sovereign Authority, Propriety and Goodness.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> In that solemn Preface which was by God himself set before the Commandments at the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them, in the 20th Chapter of <hi>Exodus.</hi>

            <p>Q. <hi>What dost thou chiefly learn by these Commandments?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>I learn two things, my Duty towards God, and my Duty to wards my Neighbour.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>My Duty towards God is to believe in him, to fear him, and to love him, with all my heart, with all my mind, with all my soul, and with all my strength: To worship him: to give him thanks: To put my whole trust in him: To call upon him: To honour his holy Name, and his Word, and to serve him truly all the days of my life.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The first forbids the worship of all false Gods, and this the worship of the true God after a false manner.</p>

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In severely punishing both the Persons and Posterity of all Idolaters, and bountifully Reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those that are Faithful.</p>

            </p>

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed de thy Name: Chy Kingdom come: Thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven: Give us this day our dally bread: And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us: And lead us not into temptation: But deliver us from evil.

            <p>A. <hi>I desire my Lord God, our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, who is the giver of all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to send his Grace unto me, and to all People, that we may worship him, serve him, &amp; obey him as we ought to do. And I pray unto God that he will send us all things that be needful both for our Souls and Bodies; and that he will be merciful unto us, and forgive us our sins: And that it will please him to save and defend us in all dangers Ghostly and Bodily; and that he will keep us from all Sin and Wickedness, and from our ghostly Enemy, and from everlasting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33157:33"/>Death. And this I trust he will do of his Mercy and Goodness, through our Lord Iesus Christ. And therefore I say, Amen. So be it.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A. <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It Teaches us both whom we are to Pray unto, and with what Frame of Spirit.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Who does it Teach us to Pray unto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To God, and to him only, <hi>Psal.</hi> 123.1.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How does this direct us unto that?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because this Title of an Universal Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding in Heaven can belong to none else but to him.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:33157:33"/>
            <p> Q. <hi>What frame of Spirit does this Preface direct us to in Prayer?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>A.</hi> It dircts us to Pray with Reverence, Charity, and Confidence.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How does it direct us to Pray with Reverence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because, as God is our Heavenly Father, he must be invested with Authority, Majesty and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Require it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How does it direct us to Pray with Charity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because it Requires us to Pray for others, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we Pray for our Selves, and to look upon them as Brethem, and therefore we do not say, <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but <hi>Our Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How does this direct us to Pray with Confidence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because it represents God as both able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Help us upon all Occasions.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But have we any particular Encouragement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these General Directions, thus to Pray to him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, we are herein taught to claim a special Interest and Propriety in him as <hi>Our</hi> particular <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

            <p>Q. <hi>How came you by these?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They were ordained and appointed by Christ himself, to be constantly used in his Church to that purpose.</p>
            <p>Q <hi>How many Sacraments hath Christ or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in his Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>Two only as generally necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Which be they?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because these are sufficient to Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:33157:36"/>
            <p> Q. <hi>But is there any necessity of these?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, they are <hi>Generally necessary</hi> wherever they may be had.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why are they thus Necessary?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because Christ hath expresly commanded them to be used.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What do you mean by their being <hi>Generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That no Persons are free from the Obligation of that Command, that are capable of them, and have opportunity.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How, or in what manner are they <hi>Generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As they are very fit and proper means for the obtaining of it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How is <hi>Baptism</hi> a means of obtaining it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As it puts us into the way of it, by admitting us into the Church of Christ, out of which there is no Promise of Salvation. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How is <hi>the Lords Supper</hi> a means of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As it is a continual Testimony of our actual Communion with the Church of Christ
<note n="(a)" place="parend">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17.</note>, and the means of Receiving and Confirming
<note n="(b)" place="parend">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.</note> that Grace which was promised us in our Baptism.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How often are these Sacraments to be used?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Baptism is to be used but once, but the Lords Supper as often as conveniently we can, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42, 46.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why is Baptism to be Administred but once?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because it is sufficient to be once admitted into the Church of Christ, as it is to be once born into any Family.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:33157:37"/>
            <p> Q. <hi>Why is the Lords Supper to be often Repeated?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because we continually want those supplies of Grace to Nourish and Strengthen us that are convey'd thereby.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What do you mean by this Word Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. <hi>I mean an Outward and Visible Sign of an inward and spiritual Grace, given unto us, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Christ himself; as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Are all these Necessary and Essential Properties of a true Sacrament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes; and if any one of them be wanting, there can be no true and proper Sacrament, which makes the five which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> add to our two, to be no Sacraments at all.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What are those Five which the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>adds to our Two, to make up the Number of Seven, which they do so much contend for, as to Accurse all that do not hold just that number?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Confirmation, Penance, Extream Unction, Orders and Matrimony.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why are not these to be accounted Sacraments, as well as the other Two of Baptism and the Lords Supper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because none of them have all the Properties of a Sacrament truly and properly so call'd as the other Two have.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q What are those Properties?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> An outward Sign of an inward Grace, and a Divine institution thereof, to be a means of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Grace, and a Pledge to assure us of it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>Because they promise them both by their Sureties, which Promise themselves when they come to Age are bound to perform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But can this any ways bind and oblige Children, since they neither do nor can actually Consent thereto themselves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, it hath been always so accounted in the Church.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>For what Reason?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because they are Capable of entring into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and therefore must of necessity be oblig'd to the Conditions of it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How prove you that they are Capable of entring into Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because God commanded them so to do by Circumcision, and did actually admit them into the Covenant of Grace thereby, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:33157:40"/>
            <p> Q <hi>But Circumcision was only the Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, not the Covenant it self?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> And so is Baptism, and so may as well be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to Children as Circumcision.</p>
            <p>Q <hi>But there was a particular Command for that, but where have you any such for this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is included in the general Command which Instituted the Ordinance of Baptism it self.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But that seems proper for grown Persons, who are Capable of understanding what they do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yet grown Persons are not more particularly mention'd than Infants are, and so the Command be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the one, no more than it does to the other.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How then are we to judge who are to be Baptiz'd, and who are not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By the Capacity of the Persons, the Command extending it self to all that are Capable of the thing.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But how can Infants be Capable of it, when they can understand nothing of its Conditions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They may be entitled to its Privileges without that, as Children commonly are in other matters in the World.</p>
            <p>Q <hi>But if Infants were included in the Command for Baptism, why should they not have been as expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd therein, as they were in the Command for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because there was no need of it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why was there no need of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because it had been the Universal Practice of the Church of God to admit Children into Covenant with him, whenever their Parents were taken in, <hi>Dent.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.13. <hi>John.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But is that sufficient?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, or else Children would be in a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33157:40"/>under the Gospel than they were under the Law, which is not to be suppos'd.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But does not our Saviours silence Conclude against it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, but rather for it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How so?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because if he had intended any Alteration in the Extent of the Covenant, he would have mention'd it, by forbidding the Baptism of Infants.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But does not his Command to Teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, require their being Taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are Baptiz'd?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, it relates to those that are Capable of being taught, as Baptism doth to those that are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being Baptiz'd, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How prove you that to be the sence of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> From the Nature of the thing, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Practice of the Church upon it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are not the Scriptures silent as to any such Practice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, they are, as they are also in many other things that were then done, but yet they own and justifie the thing.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How do they own and justifie the thing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By extending the Covenant of Grace to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and declaring them to be in it from the Faith of their Parents.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Where do they extend the Covenant of Grace to such?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. where the Penitent Jews are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to embrace Christianity for the Pardon of Sin, by the Assurance of it.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> The Promise is to you, and to your Children.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But doth not Children there signifie Posterity only, and not Irfants, why are not Capable themselves either of Repenting or Believing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It relates to that Promise made at first to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, in which all are equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Where are Children declard to be in the Covenant of Grace from the Faith of their Parents?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. where Believers that are Married to Unbelievers are Required to live with them for that Reason.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The unbelieving Husband is sanctified by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is sanctified by the Husband; else were your Children unclean, but now are they Holy.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How doth this prove Children to be in Covenant with God by the Faith of their Parents?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Because these words, Sanctified, Clean and Holy, are to be understood with Relation only to the Privilege of their-Admission into the Church by Baptism.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But do not these words signifie a Temper inherent in them, rather than a Privilege belonging to them?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because they want Faith, by which alone this is to be done.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But do not the Words of Consecration change the Bread and Wine into the real Body and Blood of Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, by no means; for it is the Faith only of the Receiver, that can make it to be so.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Whence is it then that unworthy Receivers do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> From the Words of Consecration, which make this a Sacrament, and do thereby occasion those Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects according to the Disposition of the Receiver.</p>
            <p>Q <hi>But did not Christ call it his Body and Blood when he Instituted this Sacrament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, but that doth no more make them to be so than his calling himself a Vine, or a Door, makes him to be either of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. How then is this to be understood?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In a figurative sense only, as they are the Signs and Representations, and to be used as the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of his Body and Blood.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> From Matter of Fact, and from the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How prove you this from Matter of Fact?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because he was then alive, and personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with his Disciples when he said this.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because a corporal Presence destroys the very Nature of a Sacrament, which consists of a sign, and a thing signified.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What kind of Presence then is that which we are to Expect and Believe in this Ordinance?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>A.</hi> A true spiritual Presence, which is not diseer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by our bodily Senses, but only by our Faith.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But since all things are possible with God, may not a Corporal Presence be Effected by his Almighty Power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There are so many Falsities and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in it, that it is impossible for the Power of God (who cannot lye) to be concern'd about it.</p>

            <p>Q. <hi>But do we not see Persons that have receiv'd the Sacrament fall into Sin, and neglect their Duty afterwards?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, but that is not for want of Strength▪ but for want of an honest Care to make use of that Strength that's given to them therein.</p>

            <p>O Eternal, ever blessed and most great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lord our God, in whose favour there is Life, yea whose loving Kindness is better than
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33157:48"/>Life it self, who makest the out-goings of the Morning and Evening to Praise thee, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest unto all Life and Breath, and all things: In thee we live, move and have our being, and from thee comes every thing that we do enjoy; Unto thee therefore we come at this time, to pay our Thankfull Acknowledgments for the Mercies we have already received, to beg the continuance of those which we do yet do Enjoy, and the Addition of such as we stand farther in need of. We are O Lord, less than the least of all thy Mercies, and do deserve the greatest of thy Judgments; We deserve Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Mercy, because, we have sinned against Mercies and against Judgments, and have thereby long since forfeited all our blessings and enjoyments. We cannot but Confess that we have been. Transgressors from the Womb, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

To the Original Corruption of our Natures we have added a great many Actual Transgressions; so that if by Nature we are Children of Wrath as well as others, by Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice we have made our selves ten times more so▪ we must needs acknowledge our Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness and Vileness, our sinfulness is exceeding great, it is too notorious to be Conceal'd, too heinous to be Excus'd God be merciful unto us or we are utterly undone; for Christ Jesus sake be merciful unto us in the pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of all our past Sins, in the strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33157:49"/>of us against all future Temptations, and in the preserving of us unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints.

Whilst we live in this evil World, keep us as free as may be from the evil of it, keep us from the Evil of the times and place in which we live, that we may by no means follow a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to do evil, but may choose rather to shine as Lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse Generation in which we live; Keep us from the Evil of our own Hearts, from the corrupt Inclinations of our own Natures, and from every wicked thing; Let no Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatsoever divert us from our Duty, or engage us in the Practise of any thing that is sinful and wicked; but whenever we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Bless all Orders and Degrees of Men amongst us, from the highest to the lowest; Let those whom thou hast set over us, be just, ruling in the Fear of God, and doing always those things that shall make their Government to be every way a publick Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to us, that under the influences of it, we and all

            <p>O Almighty and Everlasting God, Glorious in Holiness▪ fearfull in Praises, doing wonders, Thou art high above all Nations, and thy Glory is above the Heavens, and from thee nothing is hid; thou knowest our down-lying and our up-rising, and art acquainted with all our ways, there is not a thought in our hearts but thou knowest it altogether; and yet so foolish have we been as to sin against thee, both in thought, word, and deed, rendring our selves thereby not only unworthy of the least favour▪ from thee, but justly liable to thy wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; we must acknowledge, O God, that to us belongs nothing but shame and confusion of Face for ever; we are Vile by Nature, and have made our selves more Vile by Practices our Transgressions are multiply'd upon us, &amp; are more in number than the hairs of our Heads, and have been attended with high Aggravations, in that we have been deaf to all thy Calls, hardned against all thy Threatnings, slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and undervaluing all thy Promises, and have not been wrought upon either by Hopes or Fears, by Mercies or by Judgments; we have been full of Enmity and Obstinacy against any thing that is good, casting thy Laws behind our backs, and hating to be Reform'd; we have been wise to do evil, but to do good, have neither knowledge, good will, nor power; we have been very unthankfull for the greatest mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that have been both freely and plentifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33157:51"/>upon us, not rendring unto thee according to the benefit that we have received; yea, tho' thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fours have been renewed every moment, yet we have been unmindful of them; nay, we have rather returned Evil for Good, waxing wanton against thee, and contemptuously spurning at thy Laws, at the same time that thou hast obliged us to the strictest observance of them. We have been impatient under any Crosses and Trials, not accepting the Punishment of our Iniquity, though it be much less than we have deserv'd; but have murmur'd and repin'd, been unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and fretful; and more apt to think hardly of thee, than to acknowledge our Wickedness, or to learn Righteousness by the things that we have suffer'd; yea, though thou hast often varied the Methods and Dispensations of thy Providence, yet we have been secure and careless, not regarding thy Works, nor considering the Operations of thy Hands; but rather going on still in the Imaginations of our Hearts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising our selves peace and safety, as if we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear or hope for from thee, either here or hereafter. This our way hath been our folly, and therefore we come unto thee, Holy Father, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to pardon all that we have done amiss, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of thy tender Mercies, and for Christ Jesus's sake, to blot out all our Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: Alas! what profit is there in our Blood? suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us not to perish in our Sins, but magnifie the Riches of thy Grace, in the Salvation of our Souls, that we may praise thy great and glorious Name for ever and ever. Thou hast promised to be found of them that seek thee; yea, to seek after those that go astray from thee; look therefore with an Eye of Pity and Compassion upon us; rememember not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us our former Iniquities, but deliver us from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33157:52"/>them, and purge away our Sins for thy Name's sake. And because we have no power to resist or withstand the Temptations we may and must expect to meet withal, do thou not only pardon all our past Sins, but do thou prevent our falling into Sin again for the time to come: Keep back thy Servants from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Sins, and let them not have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us; lay such restraints upon us, as shall keep us from those Sins, which our corrupt Natures are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually prompting and urging us to commit; yea, do thou not only restrain, but renew us in the Spirit of our Minds; sanctifie us throughout both in Soul, and Spirit, and Body, and preserve us safe unto thy heavenly Kingdom: Help us to walk worthy of all the Manifestations of thy Grace, and to serve thee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully all our days. Let us not be conform'd to this World, but be transform'd, by the renewing of our Minds: Take our Affections off from things below, and set them upon things above; let our Wills be rectified, and made conformable to thy Will in all things, both in doing and in suffering whatever thou shalt call us unto; and let us learn in whatever state we are, therewith to be content, and therein to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy Name: Let that Grace of GOD which hath appear'd and brought Salvation, teach us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and to live righteously, soberly, and godly in this present evil World, and let it be our continual care to keep Consciences void of Offence towards thee, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Men, that we living in thy fear, may die in thy favour, and may be translated unto thy Glory.</p>
            <p>Be merciful unto us this Night, take us into thy Care and Protection; thou who art the Keeper of Israel, who neither slumberest nor sleepest, wake for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33157:52"/>us, and watch over us for good; Give thine Angels Charge to encamp round about us, that we may lie down in Peace, and Sleep; yea, do thou make us dwell in Safety. Refresh us with quiet and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table rest, that we may hear of thy loving Kindness in the Morning, and be the better able to serve thee in the Duties of the day following.</p>
            <p>Be gracious unto all our Kindred and Relations according to the Flesh, take Care of them all, and let nothing be wanting to them that is or shall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the making their present Lives comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or their future Lives everlastingly Happy.</p>
            <p>Be gracious to this Family, enable us all to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our several Duties, with all Faithfulness and Sincerity, living in all Peace and Unity amongst our selves, yea, considering one another to provoke unto Love and to Good Works, that so we may Adorn our Profession, and Promote the Salvation of our own, and one anothers Souls.</p>
            <p>Be good to all the Children of Affliction, comfort all that Mourn, relieve the Oppressed, bind up the Broken-hearted, deliver those that are in Bonds, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit the Sick, and according to the greatness of thy Power, preserve thou those that are appointed to Die. Take a particular Care of all those that suffer for Righteousness sake, that they may not only be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported under all their Tryals and Temptations, but Comforted with all those Consolations by which thy Servants have been enabled to Rejoyce in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions for Christ's sake; Give them a Spirit of Courage and Constancy, of Wisdom and Prudence, of Affection and Zeal for thy Truth, that they may never depart from it, or do any thing unworthy of it, but may so persevere in their Christian Course, in spight of all Difficulties whatsoever, that their very
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33157:53"/>Adversaries may be ashamed, and converted to the Faith, and thereby put the happiest End to all then Persecutions, and turn their Mourning into Joy.</p>
            <p>Be good to these Nations to which we do belong, Pardon our many and great Sins, Purge away our Corruptions, and heal our Backslidings. Remove the Judgments under which any of us do suffer, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent those which our Sins have most justly deserved, continue to us all those Mercies both Temporal and Spiritual which we do enjoy, bestow upon us the Blessings that we want, and teach us by all thy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations, to understand thy meaning towards us, and to do always that which doth best become us under them.</p>
            <p>Bless all that are in Authority, give them wise and understanding Hearts to discern between good and bad, that they may do always that which is Right, and know how to govern thy People committed to their Charge, being an Encouragement to those that do Well, and a Terror only to Evil-doers.</p>
            <p>Be Gracious to all the Ministers of thy Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Bless them with all those Gifts and Abilities that are requisite for the enabling them to discharge the Office commitred unto them, with Faithfulness and Success.</p>
